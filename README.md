# Arduino-based-soldering-station
This is a soldering station using Weller RT soldering tips
The project contains 3D model for the housing and a cirquit board using Arduino Nano microcontroller.
The source code is written i C, and uses PID library for temperature control.

This project is based on [ConnyCola](https://github.com/ConnyCola/SolderingStation/tree/master/3D)'s soldering station, but uses different source code and 3D model.
